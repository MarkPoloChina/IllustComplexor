## What it is ?

> <mark>Under Development!!</mark> It is just a simple self-use tool software and cannot be used universally so far.

Illust Complexor is a tool built by electron to manage illusts at both local and remote.

## What it can do ?

You can keep your images scattered on a file server or local hard drive and have them managed by it. Ability to freely aggregate, filter, batch process, etc. Remote API support is also available for images such as Pixiv.

Btw, it needs database server support. You must set a server to run its backend service. You can use MPI3S as its backend.
